## Discrepancies between Google Schema Validation tools and the Google Search Console Enhancement Reports and Performance Reports.
In the event your Breadcrumb is passing both structured data testing tool from [Google Test your structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data).

Since the January 31 2022, validation coming from the Google Search Console seems to currently be inaccurate. This is probably due to the recent update to the Google Search Console:

> Search Console has changed the way that it evaluates and reports errors in Breadcrumbs and HowTo structured data. As a result, you may see changes in the number of Breadcrumbs > and HowTo entities and issues reported for your property, as well as a change in severity of some issues from errors to warnings.

- Source @ https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6211453?hl=en#zippy=%2Crich-result-reports

> [...] Our team has investigated a couple of instances where this search verifies that the markup is there, despite the disagreement with Search Console and has found a solution, where the errors decline steadily over the course of a few days [...]

It would seems that the issue is coming from the Google Bot validation itelf and not the structured data of the plugin. We will continue to monitor the situation as 2022 unfold.

        <a itemprop="item" href="http://example.com/where/">
            <span itemprop="name">Where</span>
        </a>
        <meta itemprop="position" content="1">
    </li>
    >
    <li class="crumb" itemprop="itemListElement" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ListItem">
        <a itemprop="item" href="http://example.com/where/is/">
            <span itemprop="name">Is</span>
        </a>
        <meta itemprop="position" content="2">
    </li>
    >
    <li class="crumb" itemprop="itemListElement" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ListItem">
        <a itemprop="item" href="http://example.com/where/is/my/">
            <span itemprop="name">My</span>
        </a>
        <meta itemprop="position" content="3">
    </li>         
    >
    <li class="crumb" itemprop="itemListElement" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ListItem">
        <a itemprop="item" href="http://example.com/where/is/my/bread/">
            <span itemprop="name">Bread</span>
        </a>
        <meta itemprop="position" content="4">
    </li>
</ol>
```

### Styling

By default Where-Is-My-Bread has no associated stylesheet, but has two associated css classes:

- The `<ol>` tag comes with the css class, `.🍞` or `.bread` *(fallback)*.
- Each `<li>` tag comes with the class, `.crumb`.

### Minimal css boilerplate (Optional)

```
.🍞,
.bread {
  list-style-type: none;
  margin:0;
  padding:0;
}

.🍞 li,
.bread li {
  display:inline-block;
}

.🍞 li.crumb:last-child a,
.bread li.crumb:last-child a {
  text-decoration: none;
  pointer-events: none;
  color: inherit;
}
```

## Retrieving the crumbs

Even tho we recommend you to use `the_bread()` function to display and build your own breadcrumb, you can use `get_the_crumbs()` to retrieve the crumbs object.

### Example: Outputting the crumbs object

```php
<?php

var_dump( get_the_crumbs() );
```
